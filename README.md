# Smart-Lightning
The system is able utilizes a **Photo-Resistor sensor(LDR Large)** to detect the light levels and automatically control the switching of a bulb using a **BC 547 NPN Transistor**. It is powered by a **9V** battery. **Resistor** are integrated into the circuit tot regulate the current flowing into the bulb, which in this case is a **2V LED**. This setup effectively manages the bulb's on/off state based on ambient light conditions.
