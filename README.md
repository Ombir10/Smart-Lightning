# Smart-Lightning
The system is able detect the light with the use of **Photo-Resistor sensor(LDR Large)** to automatically switch on and off the bulb accordingly with the use of **Transistor( BC 547 NPN)**. The source of power for the system is a **9V** battery. The **resistor** are used for the resistance of the current passing to the bulb. The bulb used in this system is a **2V LED**.
